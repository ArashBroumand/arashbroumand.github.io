            Even though many features of github are not available for me (because of my nationality...), and the github.io is blocked by the internet providers in Iran (pfff...),
            I decided to create this page and keep it simple. Who knows what comes next...?
        <hr>
        <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
            document.write("<font color='green'>This document was last modified on "+document.lastModified+"</font>");
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
